 Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm: Detailed Explanation Including Complexities

 ACO Algorithm Overview:
 ACO is a bio-inspired optimization algorithm based on the foraging behavior of ants to find optimal paths.
 It employs a combination of constructive solution generation and pheromone updating to iteratively improve solutions.

 Key Components:
 1. Pheromone Trail: Represents the desirability of choosing a particular path, influenced by past ant decisions.
 2. Route Construction: Ants construct solutions probabilistically, considering pheromone levels and a heuristic value.
 3. Pheromone Update: After route construction, pheromones are updated to reflect the discovered quality of different paths.

 Algorithm Steps:
 - Initialize pheromone levels.
 - For each iteration:
   - Each ant constructs a path based on current pheromone levels and heuristic information.
   - Pheromone evaporation occurs, reducing all pheromone levels.
   - Ants deposit pheromones on their paths, with better paths receiving more pheromone.
 - Repeat until convergence or maximum iterations are reached.

 Time Complexity:
 The time complexity of ACO is O(num_iterations * num_ants * n^2), where num_iterations is the number of iterations
 the algorithm runs, num_ants is the number of ants used, and n is the number of nodes or points in the problem.

 Space Complexity:
 The space complexity of ACO is O(n^2) due to the need to store the pheromone matrix, where n is the number of nodes
 or points. Additional space is required for storing routes and distances, but the dominant factor is the pheromone matrix.
